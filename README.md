# ChuckTerminal
A simple python script that gets a joke each time it is run

Include "python chuck.py" in your bash profile and voila! Each time you open a new window or a tab, the terminal greets you with a Chuck Norris joke!

The jokes are fetched from [this awesome place](http://www.icndb.com).
This is how it's gonna look like.
